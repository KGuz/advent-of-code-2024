# Advent Of Code 2024 <img title="" src="./assets/icon.svg" align="left" width="90" style="padding-right: 0.5ch">
### A compilation of 2024 advent of code solutions written in Kotlin

## How to use
Create the `inputs` folder in `assets` and populate it with the files corresponding to each day of advent of code. Alternatively, you can copy the `examples` folder and rename it to `inputs`. Then, paste your advent of code inputs into the appropriate files in the newly created folder.

## Quick start
To compile and run the program, use the following command:
```
make run day=1 example=true
```

If you don't have the necessary tools installed, run the following command to fetch everything you need:
```
make sdk && source sdk/activate
```

To see a list of all available commands, type `make help`.

## Disclaimer
The solutions presented in this repository may differ from the optimal ones due to lack of experience in writing in Kotlin. The main aim of the project is to become familiar with a new programming language so proceed at your own risk :)
